            <p>
                Founded in 1983, Udo Udoma & Belo-Osagie is a multi-specialisation full service corporate and commercial law firm with offices in Nigeria’s key commercial centres. The firm’s corporate practice is supported by a company secretarial department, Alsec Nominees Limited, which provides a full range of company secretarial services and our sub-firm, U-Law which caters exclusively to entrepreneurs, MSMEs, startups, and growth businesses across several industries, including the FinTech industry.

                        Diversity is the central art piece of the firm's client-facing 12th floor. It serves as a physical embodiment of our values, representing the UUBO approach to the practice of law as well as our focus on meritocracy, celebration of diversity, and aspirations for the future.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-paragraph">
                        The Diversity geometric ironwork design comprises several spheres, irregular shapes and spoons. At its centre, 12 spoons are evenly placed in varying light and dark bronze hues. These spoons represent not just the 12 partners of the firm at the time that Diversity was created, but also the historically unique balance that we have been proud to achieve with regard to the participation of male and female lawyers in the partnership.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        None of the concentric patterns of Diversity are closed, as a nod to our culture of openness and inclusion. The larger, incomplete circle that frames the central arrangement of “partner spoons” consists of additional spoons in an array of sizes, arrangements, and hues, alluding to our commitment to future growth and expansion of the ‘’inner circle’’ of partners, and of the firm.

                        At Udo Udoma & Belo-Osagie, pro bono service is an integral part of our firm’s culture because we believe that we have a vital role to play in strengthening and developing our community and one of the ways we are able to achieve this is through our pro bono work.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-paragraph">
                        Our pro bono practice is at par with our other fee-earning practice areas, and we have a dedicated pro bono team that is committed to our work in this field. While pro bono work is not taken into account in performance evaluations, we strongly encourage all lawyers in the firm to take part in pro bono service.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As part of our pro bono work, we collaborate with reputable international pro bono organisations that receive requests for free legal support and work with a network of local and international charities. And we are always on the look out to expand this network and take on new projects. We welcome opportunities where our services can be of maximum benefit and confer meaningful social impact.
