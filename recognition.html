                        UUBO has performed exceptionally in this year’s IFLR Africa Awards 2022, receiving a total of 5 awards across 3 jurisdictional and 2 deal categories, namely: Nigeria – Law Firm of the Year; Loans Firm of the Year; M&A Firm of the Year; Loans Deal of the Year; and M&A Deal of the Year.

                        The #IFLRAfricaAwards provide a unique opportunity to celebrate leading firms and individuals behind the most innovative and challenging legal work.

                        The @IFLR1000 states that, in selecting category winners for these awards, and in addition to reviewing the role of each individual firm in the deal, it looks for new legal structures, deals that overcome new regulatory hurdles, and regional ‘firsts’ that ‘adapt existing technology to local regulation’, assessing the ‘’intricacy of that innovation…as well as likely market impact’’.
